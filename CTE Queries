Here are two SQL queries using a common table expression.

The first finds the average amount of money spent by the top 5 customers.

WITH total_amount_paid (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount)  AS 
	(SELECT A.customer_id,
		   A.first_name,
		   A.last_name,
		   D.country,
		   C.city,
		   SUM(amount) as total_amount
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
	WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, country, city
	ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5)

SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average
FROM total_amount_paid

The second finds how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country.

WITH top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount)  AS 
	(SELECT A.customer_id,
		   A.first_name,
		   A.last_name,
		   D.country,
		   C.city,
		   SUM(amount) as total_amount
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
	WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, country, city
	ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5)

SELECT D.country,
	   COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	   COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON top_5_customers.customer_id = A.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
