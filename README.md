  # SQL Rockbuster Project ðŸŽ¬

This project focused on fictional movie rental company Rockbuster Stealth LLC. Rockbuster Stealth LLC is planning to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 

## Objective

I used SQL to analyze Rockbuster's data to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. My work supplied other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries and ultimately answered complex business questions.

## Data

The data used consisted of these following tables:

### Fact Tables
- Payment
- Rental

### Dimension Tables
- Actor
- Address
- Category
- City
- Country
- Customer
- Film
- Film_Actor
- Film_Category
- Inventory
- Language
- Staff
- Store

A breakdown of the tables can be seen in the [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/danioprea/SQL_Rockbuster_Project/blob/main/Rockbuster%20Data%20Dictionary%20-%20Dani%20Oprea.pdf).

## Visualizations

All visualizations are linked in [the data analysis presentation](https://github.com/danioprea/SQL_Rockbuster_Project/blob/main/Rockbuster%20Stealth%20Data%20Analysis%20Presentation%20-%20Dani%20Oprea.pdf) but can also be found at the link [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/FWGWFGXBX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Tools

The tools I used in this project were:
- PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4)
